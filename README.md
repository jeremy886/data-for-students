# data-for-students

This repos is used to collect datasets that are meaningful for students in Australia, and maybe New Zealand to explore. Our main goal is to help students focus on things around them and teachers prepare their lessons.

- If you see csv file, you can open it up in Spreadsheet tools like Excel.
- If you see db file, you can open it up in Sqlite.
- If you see ipynb, you can open it up in Jupyter Notebook.
