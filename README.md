# data-for-students

This repos is used to collect datasets that are meaningful for students in Australia, and maybe New Zealand to explore. Our main goal is to help students focus on things around them and teachers prepare their lessons.

- If you see csv files, you can open it up in Spreadsheet tools like Excel.
- If you see db files, you can open it up in Sqlite.
- If you see ipynb files, you can open it up in Jupyter Notebook.
- If you see mdb files, you can open it up in Microsoft Access.
